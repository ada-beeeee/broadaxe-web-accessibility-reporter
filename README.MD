    What makes your project stand out?
    If your project has a lot of features, consider adding a "Features" section and listing them here.

The quality of a README description often differentiates a good project from a bad project. A good one takes advantage of the opportunity to explain and showcase:

    What your application does,
    Why you used the technologies you used,
    Some of the challenges you faced and features you hope to implement in the future.

## How to Install and Run the Project

If you are working on a project that a user needs to install or run locally in a machine like a "POS", you should include the steps required to install your project and also the required dependencies if any.

Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment set and running.

## How to Use the Project

Provide instructions and examples so users/contributors can use the project. This will make it easy for them in case they encounter a problem â€“ they will always have a place to reference what is expected.

You can also make use of visual aids by including materials like screenshots to show examples of the running project and also the structure and design principles used in your project.

Also if your project will require authentication like passwords or usernames, this is a good section to include the credentials.

## Include Credits

If you worked on the project as a team or an organization, list your collaborators/team members. You should also include links to their GitHub profiles and social media too.

Also, if you followed tutorials or referenced a certain material that might help the user to build that particular project, include links to those here as well.

This is just a way to show your appreciation and also to help others get a first hand copy of the project.
