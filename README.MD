# Axe Web Accessibility Reporter

## Description:
    What was your motivation?
    Why did you build this project?
    What problem does it solve?
    What did you learn?
    What makes your project stand out?
    If your project has a lot of features, consider adding a "Features" section and listing them here.

The quality of a README description often differentiates a good project from a bad project. A good one takes advantage of the opportunity to explain and showcase:

    What your application does,
    Why you used the technologies you used,
    Some of the challenges you faced and features you hope to implement in the future.

## How to Install and Configure the Project

- Clone this repository to your desired workspace.
- - See: [Cloning a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)

## How to Run Tests and Read Reports

Provide instructions and examples so users/contributors can use the project. This will make it easy for them in case they encounter a problem â€“ they will always have a place to reference what is expected.

You can also make use of visual aids by including materials like screenshots to show examples of the running project and also the structure and design principles used in your project.

Also if your project will require authentication like passwords or usernames, this is a good section to include the credentials.

## Credits

If you worked on the project as a team or an organization, list your collaborators/team members. You should also include links to their GitHub profiles and social media too.

Also, if you followed tutorials or referenced a certain material that might help the user to build that particular project, include links to those here as well.

This is just a way to show your appreciation and also to help others get a first hand copy of the project.

## License


            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".

  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.

  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read
